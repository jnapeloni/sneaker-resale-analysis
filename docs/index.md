# Sneaker Resale Analysis 

## Project Overview 
This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the variation and increased prices of sneakers on the resale market. The goal of this project is to understand the associations between sneaker characteristics and their resale price range,
as well as to uncover specific factors or characteristics of sneakers that are generally associated with a specific resale price range. 

## Objective 
The objectives of this project are to:  
1. Understand how sneaker characteristics affect resale price range
2. Analyze specific factors that explain the variation in sneaker resale prices
3. Build a predictive model to predict resale prices **Note: this might be removed**
4. Analyze sneaker resale trends to cluster similar shoes together

## Key Findings 
  1. The brand of sneakers is significantly associated with resale price ranges. Yeezy, Nike SB, and Jordan brand sneakers are associated with higher resale prices.
  2. Collaboration is a significant indicator variable associated with higher sneaker resale prices.
  3. Last Sale Price, Average Deadstock Price, and Lowest Asking Price are significant contributing variables in clustering similar sneakers 

## Future Work 
  1. Considering additional variables, such as the quantity of pairs produced or specific brand collaborations, may further explain the variation in sneaker resale prices.
  2. Utilizing an expanded dataset, beyond the most popular and frequently searched sneakers, may provide further insight into the discrepancies in sneaker resale prices.
