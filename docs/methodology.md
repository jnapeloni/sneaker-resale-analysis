# Methodology 

## Data Preprocessing 

Before any statistical analysis, the following steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis: 
  1. **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created `jordan.type` variable to identify the specific model of Jordan sneaker. N/A values were assigned to non-Jordan sneakers 
  - Created `collab` variable to indicate whether sneakers were apart of a collaboration between brands
  2. **Encoding `collab` Variable**:
  - The `collab` variable was converted to numeric to allow for inclusion in principal component analysis. Sneakers apart of collaborations were assigned a '2' and sneakers that are not apart of a collaboration received a '1'
  3. **Subsetting Data**:
  - A subset of the original dataset was created which only included 'Nike' brand shoes. This was done in preparation for exploratory data analysis and was named `sneakers.nikes`
  - A subset of the original dataset was created which only included the most frequently occurring brands in the dataset. These are 'Nike', 'Nike SB', 'Nike Dunk', 'Nike AF1', 'Jordan', 'adidas', 'Yeezy', and 'New Balance'. This was done in preparation for exploratory data analysis and was named `sneakers.brands`
  - A subset of the original dataset was created which only included quantitative variables. These are `retail`, `lowestAsk`, `numberOfAsks`, `salesThisPeriod`, `highestBid`, `numberOfBids`, `annualHigh`, `annualLow`, `volatility`, `deadstockSold`, `pricePremium`, `AvgDSPrice`, `lastSale`, `collab`. This was done in preparation for principal component analysis and was named `sneakers.quant`  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

I conducted exploratory data analysis both univariately and bivariately to view distributions and associations between variables in the data. 

  - **Univariate Analysis**
    - Histograms were created to observe the distributions of six quantitative variables in the data.
