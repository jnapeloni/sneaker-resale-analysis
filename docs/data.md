# Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis is the **StockX Sneaker Data** which contains information about sneakers and their sale history. This data comes from scraping the first 25 pages of StockX's (a popular sneaker resale marketplace) catalog in March 2023. The data includes information relating to both sneaker characteristics and resale market data, such as latest sale price, highest bid, lowest ask price, amongst others.
